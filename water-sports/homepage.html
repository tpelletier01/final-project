        <p>In case you didn’t know, there’s a lake up here. A big lake.
          I know—how unexpected. A beautiful, clear lake that you can splash around into your heart’s content, along with plenty of other activities.</p>
          
          <p>At South Lake Tahoe you could water ski, perhaps reenacting the infamous Fonzie-jumping-the-shark episode of Happy Days. Or be a little more X-Games-y and try wakeboarding. Maybe take a standup paddle boarding lesson and glide across the lake’s surface with dignity.</p>
          
          <p>Or take the opportunity to play that “I’m on a Boat” song and climb aboard a kayak, sailboat, or historic paddlewheeler for a sunset cruise. If that sounds utterly sleep-inducing, may we suggest hopping on a speed boat at Zephyr Cove? You’re guaranteed to terrify and delight any small children aboard as you go fast enough to make your lips flap in the breeze.</p>
          
          <p>Not predatory enough? Go fishing! With visibility to 75 feet below its surface, Lake Tahoe is home to more fish than you can shake a pole at. Just be on the lookout for Tahoe Tessie—the dragon-dinosaur that is rumored to swim in Tahoe’s depths. ‘Cause if you see her, you’ll have one awesome “one that got away” story.</p>
          
        <p>Whatever kind of aquatic adventure you embark on, finish up with a South Lake Tahoe tradition: tacos at Regan beach. If anyone looks at you funny when you’re stuffing tacos in your mouth, just nod your head sagely and tell them “it’s restorative.”</p>
