      <h2>What Needs to be Done</h2>
      <p>The first thing people need to do is realize that climate change is real. After that, those who acknowledge its existence need to go out and convince others that it is real. This can be done through word of mouth, but I believe that through websites which produce visual images like this one, a much larger impact on the minds of doubters will be made.</p>
