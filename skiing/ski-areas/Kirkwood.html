        <p>When you visit Kirkwood for the first time and round the bend on HWY 88 where the valley comes into full view, you’ll understand immediately there’s something special about Kirkwood. Our mountain is for skiers and riders with an adventurous spirit who want a pure and rewarding mountain escape.
          
          Kirkwood is a true mountain resort that provides a fulfilling and diverse on-mountain experience and a unique sense of community. Unlike other resorts in the areas, we offer a secluded mountain setting with a lifetime of progressive terrain to explore and discover, unmatched snow quality and quantity, short lift lines and wide-open slopes along with a true sense of place and a welcoming community for family and friends.
          
          Skiers and riders of all abilities love Kirkwood. There’s as much terrain for them in the trees and gullies, as there is for the chargers from the cornices. And when we say “Kirkwood has a lifetime of terrain” we’re not only talking about vastness, but how families are drawn here because it’s an excellent place to move through life—from first turns in Tahoe’s best learning terrain at Timber Creek to last runs down “The Wall”. And with over 500 inches of annual snowfall, there are plenty of powder turns to go around.</p>
